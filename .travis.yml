  # Out of the box, libvirt is configured so that users have to be added to the libvirt group in order to use it.
  # This is a very elegant design; unfortunately we can't seem to add the travis user to the libvirt group properly (newgrp halts, maybe waiting for console input?)
  # Instead, we change libvirt's configuration to consider the already-existing travis group the authorized group.
  # We did all this to fix permission problems with the setup, but it didn't even help. Oh well.

  # We do it manually in order to generate the files we need, but to do so, we need to be running as root.
  # Maybe this is a bug in Tildes's setup?
